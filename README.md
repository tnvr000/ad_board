# Coding Test - 1

Assume an AD board of size n x m and it can fit ads of different sizes 1x1, 2x2, 4x4 etc..
There are different variants of the ads that can be added to the adboard, a black and white ad, a color ad, and a flashy ad. Each ad has a lifespan of x days. The cost of ads are incremental i.e assume b/w ad costs 2/-, color ad costs 8/- and flashy ad costs 64/-

1. Write Classes and methods for the above
2. Write a program to add these ads to the adboard from time to time.
3. If an ad is removed and a few more ads are in queue then write a program in a way to replace the queue items and have the ads that give the maximum revenue.

Write a program to do to achieve the same result or You can build a Rails application out of this if you think it is needed
